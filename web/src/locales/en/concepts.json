    "title": "What is Blockchain Anchoring?",
    "description": "Anchoring is the process of cryptographically binding vehicle history data to a blockchain - Algorand. Instead of storing entire documents on-chain (which would be public and compromise privacy), we store a compact cryptographic fingerprint called a CID (Content Identifier). This CID is derived from the data itself, meaning any change to the original data would produce a different CID. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof record that proves the data existed in its current form at a specific point in time—while keeping the actual sensitive data private and under your control."
